# Myarchy

Myarchy is a still opinionated fork of omarchy, by DHH.

Read more from the original on [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org).

This fork is based on [jolleyDesign/lomarchy](https://github.com/jolleyDesign/lomarchy), that I used as base, updated, rounded some corners off, and made it more to my liking.
